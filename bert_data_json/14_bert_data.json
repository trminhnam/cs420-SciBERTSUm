consumption for transmitting a radio message .", "in this example the mote starts in a low power state ( consuming less than 100 \u00b5a ) , wakes up , and transmits the message .", "the tinyos radio stack uses the carrier sense multiple access ( csma ) collision avoidance protocol .", "when using csma , sending a message requires the mote to listen to the radio channel to detect potential collisions before beginning transmission .", "the figure clearly shows the discrete power levels for each of these operations .", "isolating the hardware consumption of each of the mote 's devices ( cpu , radio , eeprom , etc. ) required developing a set of micro-benchmarks that exercise each component independently .", "two different micro-benchmarks were written to capture the current drawn by the cpu .", "the first spun in a series of loops with known instruction counts in order to capture the per - instruction current consumption overhead .", "the second exercised each of the seven cpu

table shows , the different cpu power modes cover a wide range of current levels , from 103\u00b5a in the \" power down \" state up to 8ma when ac - tively executing instructions .", "likewise , the choice of radio transmission power affects current consumption considerably , from 3.7 ma at -20 dbm to 21.5 ma at +10 dbm .", "however , in many of our applications the radio is almost always listening for incoming messages , which consumes 7ma regardless of transmission activity .", "note that it is possible to achieve even lower energy consumption ( down to 30\u00b5a or so ) by disabling the external oscillator , jtag interface , and making various hardware modifications to the mica2 platform .", "these features have been exploited to achieve very long lifetimes in certain applications [ 24 ] , but are not used by the bulk of applications provided in the tinyos codebase .", "in any case , the power model can be readily modified to account for decreased current consumption in \" snooze \" states if one wishes to evaluate the effect of these changes.another component of power consumption is the current drawn by the sensors themselves .", "on the mica2 , analog - todigital conversion ( adc ) does not consume a measurable amount of energy , given that the adc logic is incorporated into the cpu .", "however enabling or disabling particular sensors may cause additional energy consumption while those devices are active .", "the simple mica2 sensor board does not specifically gate the supply voltage for each sensor , and thus consumes a constant current of 0.7 ma when it is attached to the mote , regardless of whether the particular sensors are being sampled .", "if a more sophisticated sensor board is used , our power model can easily incorporate the current draw of individual sensors .", "apart from the rather elaborate measurement setup shown in figure 1 , we have found it valuable to obtain real - time power consumption data from sensor nodes in a larger - scale testbed .", "we have developed a web - based interface to a wired network of 30 mica2 nodes distributed throughout our building , called motelab .", "each node is connected to an ethernet - based backchannel board that provides tcp / ip access to each mote 's serial port for data capture and reprogramming .", "the web interface allows a user to remotely reprogram the entire testbed with specified tinyos binaries , and logs messages sent to each mote 's serial port to a database .", "the data can be accessed while the job is running or used for later analysis.as part of this environment , we have instrumented one node with a network - attached digital multimeter , and implemented a server component that logs the power consumption of this node to the database as well .", "this setup provides in situ power measurements of the sensor node as it participates in the sensor network application provided by the user , requires no additional configuration ( other than clicking a checkbox in the web interface to enable the power monitoring ) and saves considerable effort on the part of sensor network developers .", "we have found it to be extremely valuable for validating experiments conducted in the powertossim environment .", "in this section we describe the overall design of power - tossim , which consists of instrumentation of the tinyos codebase to track hardware power state transitions , an accurate cpu cycle counting mechanism based on basic - blocklevel profiling , and analysis tools to visualize and analyze power

the tinyos components that access hardware ; tossim provides simulated hardware components such as a simple radio stack , sensors , and other peripherals .", "this design allows the same code that is run on real hardware to be tested in simulation at scale .", "powertossim makes use of the tinyos and tossim component model to instrument hardware state transitions for the purpose of tracking power consumption .", "this is described in detail below .", "figure 3 illustrates the architecture of powertossim .", "powertossim tracks the power state of each hardware component of the simulated motes by generating specific power state transition messages that are logged during the simulation run .", "this is accomplished by instrumenting the tossim simulated hardware components with calls to a new component , powerstate , which tracks hardware power states for each mote and logs them to a file during the run .", "estimating cpu usage is somewhat more involved : since powertossim runs the mote software as a native binary on the host machine , it has no information on the length of time that a given mote spends using the cpu .", "cpu profiling is accomplished by mapping the basic blocks executed by the simulation code to cycle counts in the corresponding mote binary ; this is described further in section 4.4 .", "the power state data generated by powertossim can be combined with a power model , such as that described in section 3 , to determine per - mote and per - component energy usage .", "this processing can be performed using offline tools to obtain detailed traces of power consumption for each hardware component of each mote , or fed into the tinyviz visualization tool to display power consumption data in realtime.we chose to decouple the generation and processing of power state transition data for two reasons : efficiency and flexibility.efficiency : .", "one of the important characteristics that powertossim inherits from tossim is its very high efficiency in simulating large networks that scale to thousands of nodes .", "to preserve this efficiency , it is important to avoid introducing high overheads into the simulation itself .", "logging hardware state transition messages at runtime introduces very low overhead .", "likewise , allowing the simulation to run as a native binary avoids the overhead of instruction - level simulation.flexibility : .", "it is also important to provide a high degree of flexibility for capturing and modeling the power state of the mote ; we did not want to assume a particular hardware platform , as new designs are constantly being considered .", "with the decoupled design it is possible to evaluate the power efficiency of potential hardware designs only by plugging a new power model into the analysis tools ; the simulation itself need not be re-executed .", "the following subsections present the design of each part of the powertossim architecture in detail .", "in tinyos , each of the mote 's hardware components is driven by a specific software module that is responsible for controlling its operation .", "for example , the cc1000radiointm module handles most aspects of radio communication using the chipcon cc1000 radio .", "tossim replaces many of these hardware drivers with its own simulated versions , making it possible to link a tinyos application to the simulated hardware with very few code changes .", "powertossim leverages this design by instrumenting each of the simulated hardware drivers with power state transition messages that are logged during the simulation .", "this is accomplished by adding calls from each hardware driver to a new module , called powerstate , that emits log messages when the power state of each hardware device changes .", "abstracting power state transitions in a separate module allows the interface to be readily extended to support new hardware components , such as new sensor platforms .", "as described above , tossim achieves scalability by compiling the tinyos application code into a binary that runs directly on the simulation host .", "while very efficient , this design makes it difficult to determine how much time each simulated mote 's cpu spends in the active state ( actively executing instructions ) versus the idle state , or any of the ware components ( radio , sensors , leds , etc. ) make calls to the powerstate module ,

active messaging component that makes up the upper level of the radio stack ) other low - power states .", "tracking the amount of time the cpu spends active is important for accurately capturing power consumption , especially for applications that make use of cpu - intensive operations ( such as encryption ) or that spend much time in low - power sleep modes , only to wake up and perform computation infrequently .", "the simple microcontrollers used on current sensor node designs consume approximately constant power while executing instuctions .", "this is due to the fact that they do not use the sophisticated chip level power management strategies present in more advanced processors , so the instuction core , sram , adc , oscillator , timer , and other peripherals are always on when the controller is in active mode.recalling table 1 , the atmel atmega128l cpu consumes about 8 ma while executing instructions , and 3.2 ma while idle .", "likewise , the cycle time for each instruction is well - documented and usually deterministic , or at least predictable .", "therefore , to compute cpu energy usage it is adequate to track the amount of time the cpu spends in each power state .", "the amount of time that a node spends in idle mode depends on external factors , such as the timing of clock interrupts , that are already modeled by tossim .", "however , the amount

consumption .", "our approach for determining the amount of time that each simulated mote 's cpu is active is to instrument the tossim application to report basic block execution counts , and then map each basic block to the appropriate number of instructions as executed by the mote .", "this avoids the overhead of instruction - level simulation while maintaining relatively accurate cpu cycle counts .", "the nesc compiler parses an entire tinyos component graph and emits a single c source code file that is then compiled with a back - end compiler appropriate for the target platform ( e.g. , avr - gcc in the case of the mica2 motes ) .", "we exploit this design by instrumenting this intermediate c source file with basic block execution counters .", "this is accomplished using c intermediate language ( cil ) [ 16 ] , a toolkit for programmatically manipulating c source code files .", "cil builds a high - level representation of the structure of the c program and permitting easy analysis and sourceto - source transformations.our use of cil involved writing a set of source transformation rules that inserted an execution counter into each basic block of the program .", "this transformation requires less than 100 lines of ocaml code .", "in addition to modifying the nesc - generated source code , the transformation code records the original nesc source file and line number corresponding to each basic block , allowing us to map basic blocks back to their original source code line number.the next step is to map each basic block to the appropriate number of cpu instructions as executed by the atmega128l on the mica2 .", "this is accomplished by compiling the tinyos application to a mica2 binary and using a disassembler ( avr - objdump ) to determine the set of avr instructions for each source code line .", "this is then correlated with the basic block line number information to obtain the set of assembly instructions corresponding to each basic block .", "to obtain cpu cycle counts , the number of cycles for each avr instruction in the basic block ( obtained from the atmega128l data sheet [ 4 ] ) is totaled .", "in cases where an instruction can consume a variable number of cycles , the expected number of cycles for each instruction is used.after the simulation executes , the basic block execution counts are recorded in the powertossim log .", "postmortem analysis is then used to determine the cpu cycle counts for each mote using the technique described above.there are several complications with this scheme .", "one is that a single c source code line may get compiled into several basic blocks , each of which is counted separately in the simulated code .", "since the c - to - assembly mapping contains all of the assembly instructions for each source line , whenever any basic block contained in the line gets executed , it counts as if the entire line was executed .", "this leads to overcounting.another problem is that not all of the code executed by the simulation is present in the avr binary , since tossim provides its own replacements for a number of low - level hardware modules .", "these basic blocks have no mapping to avr assembly instructions , and are simply ignored in the cpu cycle counts , which leads to undercounting cycles .", "however , nearly all of this code corresponds to low - level hardware drivers , which are primarily accounted for by the other components of the hardware model .", "the bulk of the tinyos codebase ( system - level services , libraries , and application code ) is shared between the tossim and mote environments , and accounts for a significant proportion of the cpu execution time of typical applications.the accuracy of our cycle count estimator is shown in table 3 .", "for comparison we obtained cycle count numbers from atemu [ 11 ] , an instruction - level simulator for the avr platform .", "because atemu simulates the individual instructions , we assume that the cycle counts it produced are extremely accurate .", "encryption and decryption operations were performed using the skipjack encryption module from tinysec [ 12 ] .", "as the table shows , our method is fairly accurate for application level code , although some discrepancies do arise , for example , in qsort ( ) .", "we believe this to be due to cases where a small number of basic blocks that happen to have slightly inaccurate cycle mappings account for the majority of cpu time .", "we have developed several tools for analyzing and visualizing the power consumption data generated by power - tossim .", "these tools take as input the log files generated by powerstate , the cpu profiling information , and a hardware power model .", "the first tool is a postprocessor that computes energy totals for the various hardware components for each mote as well as outputting a time series trace of power con - sumed by each mote ( example graphs of these traces are shown in section 6 ) .", "we have also implemented a plugin for tinyviz , the javabased visualization environment for tossim , that reports per - mote power consumption as the simulation runs .", "the plugin also assigns a color to each mote based on how much power it has consumed during the course of the run , making it possible to visualize power hotspots in the network .", "figure 5 shows a typical screenshot of the visualization.another tool uses the basic block execution counters produced by the cpu profiler and generates an ordered list of the tinyos components that consume the most cpu cycles during the run .", "this list can also be broken down by basic block .", "this analysis is extremely valuable for understanding the overhead of various components in a tinyos application .", "note that analysis of the tossim binary itself is generally not adequate as there is little correspondence between the number of instructions executed on , e.g. , an x86 machine and that on an 8 - bit microcontroller lacking hardware floating - point support .", "table 4 shows an example of this tool run on the tinydb [ 15 ] sensor network query processor .", "this section presents the evaluation of powertossim along two axes : validation of the simulated power consumption data against real hardware for a range of applications , and powertossim 's ability to scale to very large simulations .", "to validate powertossim 's energy consumption estimates , we ran a range of real tinyos applications both on power - tossim and on an actual mote that was instrumented to obtain power traces .", "most of these applications were drawn from the standard tinyos distribution and were chosen to represent a broad range of typical sensor network programs .", "many of the applications , such as blink and sense , are sim - ple demonstration programs that exercise particular features of the motes .", "most of these programs perform some combination of sensing , blinking leds , transmitting radio messages , and recording data in the eeprom ; their function is mostly self - explanatory from the program name.beacon is the only program in our benchmark suite that uses the low - power sleep states of the mica2 .", "it transmits a radio beacon message every two seconds but drops the cpu to a low power mode between each beacon ; the other programs consume considerably more cpu energy since they sit in the ( relatively higher - power ) idle mode when not executing instructions.in addition to these simple benchmarks , we examined two more involved applications : tinydb and surge .", "tinydb [ 15 ] is a sophisticated program that provides a query interface to sensor network data .", "it involves sensing , aggregation , communication , and computation .", "surge is an adaptive multihop routing protocol that forms a spanning tree rooted at the wired base station node .", "each node periodically takes a sensor reading and routes it to the root .", "surge performs complex radio link quality estimation for parent selection in the routing tree .", "these applications were run in a small network of several motes , as described in section 6.4 , below .", "table 5 presents total simulated and measured energy numbers for a 60 second run of each application .", "as the table shows , powertossim achieves excellent accuracy , with an average error of just 4.7 % compared to the actual mote , and a maximum error of about 13 % .", "some of this difference between simulated energy and measured energy can be attributed to voltage fluctuations , noise and rounding error in the experimental setup .", "other differences may be due to inaccuracies in the power model or in cpu cycle counting , though we believe that we are accurately capturing nearly all of the hardware power transition states .", "table 6 shows the simulated energy consumption for each application broken down by hardware component .", "power - tossim makes it extremely easy to perform this kind of analysis , which is otherwise extremely difficult for real sensor nodes .", "the behavior of several applications depends on the particular sensor readings that they obtain .", "for example , sensetoleds takes a light sensor reading and displays the highorder bits of the reading using the 3 leds .", "consequently , the total energy consumed depends on the light intensity of the environment , which is difficult to match in the simulation .", "to avoid this , we simply disabled the leds in these applications , which explains why the leds are shown as not consuming energy for several applications that would otherwise have done so.some interesting observations can be made using this data .", "while active cpu energy ( when executing actual instructions ) is very small , the total cpu energy consumes a significant fraction of the energy for the entire run .", "this is because most applications leave the cpu in the 3.2 ma idle state rather than using the lower - power sleep modes .", "however , even for the beacon application , which uses low - power sleep , the cpu consumes a considerable fraction of the overall energy .", "in this case , the cpu must be active to transmit outgoing beacon messages a byte at a time .", "packet - based radio interfaces ( such as the chipcon cc2420 ) may provide significant savings in this regard .", "another lesson to take away is that the leds draw a significant amount of current , and should be used for debugging but disabled when the application is actually deployed .", "in addition to total energy consumption data , powertossim outputs realtime traces of simulated current draw .", "we verified that these traces correspond well with the measured oscilloscope trace for the same application .", "figure 6 shows the measured and simulated current for the beacon application .", "note the two small peaks between every pair of large peaks .", "the large peaks every 2 sec are due to message transmissions , while the smaller peaks are due to the cpu waking up briefly to increment a counter .", "powertossim successfully captures all the details of the real trace , including the spurious cpu wakeups.many of the sensor applications that we tested had rather dry behaviors , that is , they spend most of their time in idle mode and transmit a message or blink an led periodically .", "to demonstrate a more interesting application , we measured cnttoledsandrfm , which increments an internal counter each time a 4 hz timer fires .", "the lower 3 bits of the counter are displayed on the 3 leds , resulting in an interesting pattern of current consumption as shown in figure 7 .", "the program also transmits a message with the counter value on each timer interrupt .", "the graph clearly shows the radio messages and the leds cycling through the sequence from 0 to 7 .", "in addition to the simple benchmarks presented earlier , we evaluated tinydb and surge , which represent more complex sensor network applications .", "we find that powertossim does a very good job at estimating the power consumption of these applications as well.the last 3 lines table 5 present the results for tinydb and surge .", "there are two tinydb tests .", "the first is tinydb in idle mode , with no running queries .", "in this mode , tinydb simply performs periodic network topology maintenance and listens for new queries .", "the second measurement was taken a breakdown according to radio , leds , and cpu current .", "a lower resolution digital multi-meter was used for the above measurement , which did not capture the very short duration peak power spikes during the wakeups.running the query \" select light from sensors sample period 1024 . \"", "this query reports the value of the light sensor on each mote once every 1024 ms. the error for tinydb is higher than for most of the benchmark applications , though we believe this is partly due to the fact that tinydb exhibits somewhat different behavior in simulation than it does on actual hardware .", "surge forms a spanning - tree - based multihop route from each node to a wired basestation .", "each node performs periodic estimations of the link quality to its neighbors and attempts to select a parent node that will maximize the probability of its messages reaching the base station .", "each node samples its light sensor and generates a message once every 2 sec .", "therefore , nodes that have children in the routing tree will relay both the messages of their children as well as their own messages .", "with this approach , it is possible that some nodes become \" hotspots \" that forward many more packets than other nodes.as shown in table 5 , powertossim captures the overall power consumption of surge with very high accuracy ( 3 % error ) .", "in this measurement , we instrumented a single surge node with several other network nodes relaying data to it .", "using powertossim , we were interested to verify whether hotspots in the routing tree really lead to increased power consumption on those nodes .", "to induce a specific hotspot in the routing tree , we modified the surge code to always form the topology depicted in figure 8 , and ran the resulting network in powertossim .", "in this arrangement , mote 1 has three children and will have four times more radio packets to send out than other nodes in the network .", "figure 9 shows the simulated energy consumption for each node as well as the total number of transmitted messages .", "the hotspot node sends out about three times more messages than the other motes in the network , as expected .", "however , the energy consumption of the hotspot is not very different from the other nodes .", "this is because surge does not use the low power cpu and radio modes between transmitting messages .", "because the relative rate of message forwarding is quite low ( no more than 2 messages / sec on the hotspot node versus 0.5 messages / sec for the other nodes ) , there is very little difference in the simulated energy consumption for each node .", "finally , we evaluate the overhead of power profiling in powertossim with respect to both the original tossim environment upon which it is based , as well as atemu [ 11 ] , an avr instruction - level simulator that is capable of simulating multiple motes .", "performance tests were run on a 2.4 ghz pentium 4 machine running linux with 512 mb of main memory and 512kb l2 cache .", "the results are shown in figure 10 .", "in all cases we ran the oscilloscoperf application which takes periodic sensor readings and broadcasts them as radio messages .", "each run was for 300 virtual seconds.as can be seen , powertossim without cpu cycle counters ( that is , only instrumenting the hardware state transitions using powerstate ) has little measurable overhead over tossim .", "in the 1000 - mote case , the time for powertossim was within 1 % of the time for tossim .", "adding basic block counters increases the amount of memory used in the simulator , which causes a slowdown when simulating a large number of motes .", "for oscilloscoperf , there are approximately 4kb of counters per mote , which overflows the 512kb l2 cache at about 125 simulated motes .", "this explains the inflection point above 100 simulated motes in the figure.we also compare powertossim 's performance to atemu , which performs instruction - level simulation and executes each simulated mote as a separate thread .", "we show data for up to 50 simulated motes in atemu .", "for this application , atemu is approximately 20 times slower than powertossim due to the high overhead of instruction - level simulation , which limits its value for simulating large networks .", "however , atemu does provide very accurate instruction - level analysis of the simulated mote , which can be valuable when this level of detail is warranted .", "we were able to achieve excellent correspondence between simulation and our experiments .", "however , a real world deployment would likely see more variance in actual energy usage due to environmental variation that can be carefully controlled in the lab .", "the main factors are : \u2022 supply voltage - this is the most important factor that can contribute to energy use variability .", "voltage has a linear effect on current and a quadratic effect on power and energy .", "as motes such as the mica2 commonly run on regular batteries with a voltage range from 1.8 to 3.0 volts , this can lead to very large fluctuations in energy use .", "\u2022 event response to environment - as discussed above , sensor network applications often have behavior that depends on the particular readings obtained .", "thus , the energy used by a network may be vastly different if it detects a lot of events that require some sort of processing ( sending radio messages , blinking leds , etc ) .", "this is fairly obvious , but is hard to quantify in a simulator .", "\u2022 temperature - temperature has a fairly small effect on active current ( only a few percent ) .", "however , if the device is in an extremely low power sleep mode temperature variations can have a more drastic affect on leakage current .", "since nodes in many sensor network applications spend much of their time in sleep mode , it is important to be aware of this .", "unfortunately , it is difficult to quantify in general , and we were unable to obtain any datasheets on it , as it depends on manufacturing tolerances.environmental factors like temperature and humidity can also affect the reliability of the motes [ 24 ] .", "as a result , it is difficult to predict the overall failure behavior of the network .", "as the sensor network community expands in terms of size and scope of interest , we believe it is critical that effective tools be produced to understand the behavior of sensor network applications .", "while real - world deployments are ultimately the ideal evaluation environment , simulation tools have a great deal of value for debugging , testing , and experimenting with applications in a controlled setting.this paper addresses a pressing need for this community : that of modeling the power consumption of sensor network applications .", "rather than sacrificing scalability and efficiency by using a low - level hardware simulation , we propose the use of efficient emulation of the sensor node hardware platform coupled with careful instrumentation of the power states .", "powertossim generates an event - driven simulator directly from tinyos code and emits power state transitions for multiple hardware peripherals ( radio , sensors , leds , etc. ) .", "in addition , powertossim obtains an accurate estimate of cpu cycle counts for each mote by measuring basic block execution counts and mapping each basic block to microcontroller instructions .", "we have demonstrated that powertossim obtains very accurate power consumption results for a wide range of tinyos applications and exhibits very little overhead above that of the tossim environment upon which it is based.we envision a number of future directions for powertossim itself as well as for studies that this tool enables .", "powertossim 's flexible power model allows both current and future sensor node designs to be evaluated with respect to power efficiency .", "we are currently designing a novel sensor node architecture and intend to use the powertossim environment to model its behavior in large - scale deployments in advance of taping out actual hardware .", "as part of this effort we are building a sensor network \" benchmark suite \" that can be used to understand the tradeoffs between generality , performance , and energy requirements across a range of applications .", "finally , powertossim makes it possible to adding basic block counting increases overhead somewhat .", "also shown is the total size of the powertossim log file and the time to simulate up to 50 motes using atemu , an instruction - level simulator for motes.understand the energy consumption of a sensor network as a whole , rather than simply at the per - node level .", "many
