environments that involve multiple decoupled auctions .", "these settings are complex partly because an agent 's strategy depends on information about other bidders ' interests .", "when bidders ' valuation distributions are not known ex ante , machine learning techniques can be used to approximate them from historical data .", "it is a characteristic feature of auctions , however , that information about some bidders ' valuations is systematically concealed .", "this occurs in the sense that some bidders may fail to bid at all because the asking price exceeds their valuations , and also in the sense that a high bidder may not be compelled to reveal his valuation .", "ignoring these \" hidden bids \" can introduce bias into the estimation of valuation distributions .", "to overcome this problem , we propose an em - based algorithm .", "we validate the algorithm experimentally using both synthetic and real - world ( ebay ) datasets , and show that our approach estimates bidders ' valuation distributions and the distribution over the true number of bidders significantly more accurately than more straightforward density estimation techniques .", "there has been much research on the study of automated bidding agents for auctions and other market - based environments .", "the trading agent competitions ( tac ) and the tac supply chain management competitions ( tac - scm ) have attracted much interest [ 14 ] .", "there have also been research efforts on bidding agents and bidding strategies in other auction environments [ 5,4,7,3,6,2 ] .", "although this body of work considers many different auction environments , bidding agents always face a similar task : given a valuation function , the bidding agent needs to compute an optimal bidding strategy that maximizes expected surplus .", "( some environments such as tac - scm also require agents to solve additional , e.g. , scheduling tasks . )", "the \" wilson doctrine \" in mechanism design argues that mechanisms should be constructed so that they are \" detail - free \" - that is , so that agents can behave rationally in these mechanisms even without information about the distribution of other agents ' valuations .", "for example , under the vcg mechanism it is a weakly dominant strategy to bid exactly one 's valuation , regardless of other agents ' beliefs , valuations or actions .", "under common assumptions ( in particular , independent private values ) single - item english auctions are similar : an agent should remain in the auction until the bidding reaches the amount of his valuation.while detail - free mechanisms are desirable , however , they are not ubiquitous .", "very often , agents are faced with the problem of deciding how to behave in games that do not have dominant strategies and where other agents ' payoffs are strategically relevant .", "for example , we may want to participate in a series of auctions run by different sellers at different times .", "depending on the assumptions we choose to make about other bidders , two approaches to computing bidding strategies suggest themselves : a game theoretic approach and a decision theoretic approach .", "the game theoretic approach assumes that all agents are perfectly rational and that this rationality is common knowledge ; the auction is modeled as a bayesian game ( see , e.g. , the survey in [ 8 ] ) .", "under this approach , a bidding agent would compute a bayes - nash equilibrium of the auction game , and play the equilibrium bidding strategy .", "for example , for environments with multiple , sequential auctions for identical items and in which each bidder wants only a single item , milgrom and weber [ 9,13 ] identified bayes - nash equilibria .", "such equilibria very often depend on the distribution of agents ' valuation functions and the number of bidders .", "although this information is rarely available in practice , it is usually possible to estimate these distributions from the bidding history of previous auctions of similar items .", "note that this involves making the assumption that past and future bidders will share the same valuation distribution.the game - theoretic approach has received a great deal of study , an is perhaps the dominant paradigm in microeconomics .", "in particular , there are very good reasons for seeking strategy profiles that are resistant to unilateral deviation .", "however , this approach is not always useful to agents needing to decide what to do in a particular setting , especially when the rationality of other bidders is in doubt , when the computation of equilibria is intractable , or when the game has multiple equilibria .", "in such settings , it may be more appropriate to rely on decision theory .", "a decision theoretic approach treats other bidders as part of the environment , and ignores the possibility that they may change their behavior in response to the agent 's actions .", "as above , we again make the assumption that the other bidders come from a population that exhibit stationary bidding behavior ; however , this time we model agents ' bid amounts directly , rather than modeling their valuations and then applying an equilibrium strategy .", "we then solve the resulting single - agent decision problem to find a bidding strategy that maximizes expected payoff .", "we could also use a reinforcement - learning approach , where we continue to learn the bidding behavior of other bidders while participating in the auctions .", "this paper does not attempt to choose between these two approaches ; it is our opinion that each has domains for which it is the most appropriate .", "the important point is that regardless of which approach we elect to take , we are faced with the subproblem of estimating two distributions from the bidding history of past auctions : the distribution on the number of bidders , and the distribution of bid amounts ( for decision theoretic approaches ) or of valuations ( for game theoretic approaches ) .", "it might seem that there is very little left to say on this topic : we learn the distributions of interest from historical data and then compute a bidding strategy based on that information for the current auction .", "however , bidding histories often systematically omit relevant information .", "for example , in sealed bid auctions , the auctioneer may choose not to reveal the bid amounts except the price the winner pays .", "an english auction is stopped when there is only one active bidder left ( i.e. , when the second - highest bidder drops out ) , meaning that the valuation of the highest bidder is not revealed .", "how can we learn valuation distributions when the data available to us is biased in this way ?", "for concreteness , in this paper we focus on a single domain ; however , our techniques are broadly applicable .", "here we consider sequential english auctions in which a full
