about the message to be sent given its valuation , and the payoffs are determined as above .", "the solution of this game is given by computing a ( bayesian nash ) equilibrium of it : a joint strategy

auctions is quite standard .", "for example , if valuations are selected according to the uniform distribution on [ 0,1 ] and there is no participation fee , then the strategy of agent i in equilibrium is bi ( vi ) = n \u2212 1 n vi .", "more generally , several auctions may be conducted in parallel .", "we first consider the case of two parallel auctions of similar goods .", "a parallel auction is given in this case by a pair a = ( a1 , a2 ) , where ai = n , g , c , d , ( i = 1 , 2 ) as before.one such problem is a parallel auction for substitute goods , in which the set of possible buyers n is shared among a1 and a2 , and each agent 's valuation for the pair of goods { g1 , g2 } equals its valuation for g1 which equals its valuation for g2 .", "agent i s strategy consists of two parts : 1 .", "it selects at most one of the auctions , in which it will participate .2 .", "it submits a bid in the selected auction.parallel auctions for substitute goods define a bayesian game in a natural way .", "for example , if the auctions are second - price auctions , then an appropriate equilibrium of the corresponding parallel auction is as follows : each agent randomly selects one of the auctions , and sends his actual valuation as his bid there.another type of parallel auction is the parallel auction for complementary goods .", "here we have two similar auctions , e.g. second - price auctions , for two different goods g1 and g2 .", "the set of agents n = n1 \u222a n2 \u222a np consists of three parts : \u2022 n1 are agents that are interested only in g1 \u2022 n2 are agents

ease of exposition we will assume that we can distinguish whether an agent is from group n1 , n2 , or np , and that the agents in np have extremely high negative utility for losses .", "this second assumption means that an agent will never submit bids in both auctions ; notice that we assumed that an agent who is interested in obtaining a pair of goods has a valuation of 0 for getting only one of them , and therefore by bidding in two auctions the agent may end up getting and paying for only one good .", "hence , we will assume that the strategies available to the agents are as in the case of substitute goods.we will rely on the notion of surplus in our evaluation of coordinators for parallel auctions .", "the surplus of an allocation is defined as the sum of agents ' valuations for that allocation .", "for example , in a parallel auction for substitute goods the surplus of an allocation that assigns good g1 in auction 1 to agent i , and assigns good g2 in auction 2 to agent j , is v1 ( g1 ) + v2 ( g2 ) ( i.e. , the sum of these agents ' valuations for the goods they are assigned ) .", "let g \u2282 n , where 1 < | g | < n. w.l.o.g let the elements of g be { 1 , 2 , . . . , |
