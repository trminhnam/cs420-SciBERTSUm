pass filter ( the red line in fig. 7 ) .", "the smoothed signal is then analyzed with a sliding window ( \u03b4t on ) of 60 samples or 1 min of sensed average temperature.the occurrence of a heat - rising event corresponds to a condition in which the temperature difference between the beginning and ending time in the sliding window exceeds a threshold \u03b4t = 0.2 \u2103 , indicating a slow but substantial change .", "this is determined by the average heat -

falling rate is not uniform across the appliance surface .", "to detect the temperature changing trend of each pixel , the system calculates the temperature difference ( t diff ) of a pixel between the current temperature and the previous temperature recorded 60 seconds earlier ( a time interval long enough to reflect the falling trend ) .", "the system can then classify each pixel into one of three temperature - changing categories : a temperature - rising pixel ( t diff > t ) , a temperature - falling pixel ( t diff < - t ) , and a temperature - fixed pixel ( - t \u2266 t diff \u2266 t ) .", "the temperature threshold , t , is determined by the temperature resolution of the thermal camera ( t = 0.3 \u2103 in the current implementation ) .", "a heat -

falling pixels exceeds the percentage of temperature - rising pixels by 10 % .", "this module resolves the appliance - on ( - off ) time and operating duration of each appliance usage session .", "each appliance - on ( - off ) state change generates a pair of power and heat events that are correlated with each other in event occurrence time .", "therefore , this module infers the applianceon ( - off ) times by finding the optimal matched pairs of power and heat events based on time proximity , which can be formulated as an event assignment problem [ 13 ] .", "each operating duration can then be obtained by calculating the time difference between on and off time .", "this module involves the following three steps : ( 1 ) appliance -
