i , and \u2022 a directed edge s i \u2192 s j denotes that s i copies tuples from s j , and the edge is associated with an \" annotation \" describing tuples copied by s i from s j .", "2there are at least three kinds of annotations for copying edges and accordingly we have three types of dependency graphs : ( 1 ) fraction - copying dag : the annotation on s i \u2192 s j is a fraction f i , j ( called selectivity ) denoting the fraction of tuples copied by s i from s j ; ( 2 ) select - copying dag : the annotation on edge s i \u2192 s j is a select condition composed of predicates of the form a op a , where a is an attribute in s j , a is a constant , and op is one of = , < , \u2264 , > , \u2265 , and all tuples in s j satisfying the select condition are copied into s i ; ( 3 ) histogram - copying dag : the annotation on edge s i \u2192 s j is a histogram specifying the copying fraction for each range of possible attribute values .", "note that we leave projection in copying

we refer to s i as a copier .", "we say that s i is a full - copying copier , if it copies all data from the original sources whenever it copies anything .", "in this case , we call the dependency graph a fullcopying dag .", "we say that s i is a single - source copier , if it is a full - copying copier and copies from a single source .", "we restrict ourselves to a dag and not an arbitrary directed graph because we do not consider cases in which sources ( transitively ) copy data from themselves.we assume that each tuple is annotated with the source from which it was copied , or marked as independently added .", "that is , tuples are of the form ( t , s ) where t is the tuple value , and s is the source that independently provided t .", "we assume that sources are sets of tuples .", "hence , even if a tuple ( t , s ) is obtained by copying from multiple sources , only one copy of the tuple is retained in the source.the total number of tuples in a source s i , denoted by | s i | ,

our solutions for one prototypical query : find all the tuples from the sources , denoted q ( s ) .", "this prototypical query already unveils many of the challenges that arise in our context .", "in practice , the majority of queries tend to ask for all the tuples that satisfy certain predicates .", "section 6 describes a transformation that shows how our solutions to the prototypical query apply

annotated by the source that independently provide it .", "hence , if tuple t was independently provided by both s 1 and s 2 then both ( t , s i ) and ( t , s j ) will be in the answer.our goal is to take advantage of the dependency between sources to compute q ( s ) more efficiently .", "hence , we will typically try to answer the query ( or get a near - complete answer ) from a subset t \u2286 s

the cost of computing q ( t ) under the linear cost model is c ( t ) = si \u2208 t | s i | .", "2the intuition behind the linear cost model is that looking at the data sources and performing the union can be done in near - linear time in the size of the answers returned from each data source ( and certainly in linear time in the number of i / os ) using either a hash table or an ordered index.we also consider the following variations on the cost model and show that they have subtle effects on the complexity results in several cases .", "in such a cost model , the objective is to minimize the number of sources being queried .", "such a model might be applicable if the system is being charged for every query over any of the sources .", "arbitrary source cost model ( ascm ) : here we assume each source s i is associated with an arbitrary cost c i incurred in querying it .", "hence , c ( t ) = si \u2208 t c i .", "such a cost model can be useful in many scenarios , such as capturing the cost of setting up network connection and the delay caused by the system being overburdened on answering other queries.coverage : given a subset of sources t , we would like to define the coverage of
