surprising results .", "in particular , we show that in certain cases , even extremely small fluctuations can cause these dynamics to spin out of control and move to states of much higher social cost , whereas in other cases these dynamics are much more stable even to large degrees of fluctuation .", "we also consider the resilience of these dynamics to a small number of byzantine players about which no assumptions are made .", "we show again a contrast between different games .", "in certain cases ( e.g. , fair cost - sharing , set - covering , job - scheduling ) even a single byzantine player can cause best - response dynamics to transition to states of substantially higher cost , whereas in others ( e.g. , the class of \u03b2 - nice games which includes routing , market - sharing and many others ) these dynamics are much more resilient .", "it is widely accepted that rational agents in competitive environments can be viewed as utility maximizers .", "economic theory has gone to great lengths to justify this assumption , and deriving it from basic plausible axioms .", "major milestones in this line of research include von - neumann and morgenstein [ 23 ] , de finetti [ 9 ] and savage [ 19 ] .", "in essence , these results connect between agents ' preferences , likelihoods of events , and utility functions .", "( we should remark that there is a line of work in behavioral economics which challenges this approach , for example the well known works of kahneman and tversky [ 21 ] . )", "in this work we explore how small fluctuations or uncertainties about agents ' own utilities can substantially affect social welfare when players follow natural dynamics.in many cases we can view the agents ' utility functions as being based on measurements of some physical quantities .", "for example in job scheduling , the speed of each machine is a physical quantity which determines the load on each machine .", "an agent has to approximate this speed from its observation , where the simplest way is to consider the ratio of output quantity and time .", "even if the output quantity is given , different agents might have ( slightly ) different measurements of time , which will cause them to compute slightly different machine speeds .", "even the same agent might hypothesize different speeds for the same machine at different times , due to imperfection in its clock .", "we can model this phenomenon as follows .", "we assume that each machine has an absolute speed s , and at each time t each agent i observes a speed s t i \u2208 [ s / ( 1 + \u01eb ) , s ( 1 + \u01eb ) ] , for some uncertainty parameter \u01eb > 0 .", "this modeling of uncertainty is reminiscent of the statistical query learning model of kearns [ 12 ] .", "in other situations , even without uncertainty in measurement , the underlying game itself may exhibit small fluctuations in cost .", "for example , consider a transportation problem where each agent selects a route .", "we might model edges as having delay functions that are , say , linear in the amount of traffic on them , but in reality delays may also depend on external environmental factors which have been abstracted out of the model .", "therefore delays would not be exactly identical at two different times even if the amount of traffic at those times is the same .", "we can again view this similarly : at each time t , resource j has cost c t j \u2208 [ cj / ( 1 + \u01eb ) , cj ( 1 + \u01eb ) ] where cj is the \" base \" cost of that resource , and \u01eb is a degree - of - fluctuation parameter .", "in fact , this same issue of fluctuations in actual ( in addition to perceived ) costs may occur in job scheduling as well.the question we are interested in is : can these fluctuations ( in either perceived or actual costs ) cause best - response and improvedresponse dynamics to spin out of control and move from highquality states to states of much worse social welfare ?", "what values of \u01eb can different well - studied games tolerate ?", "we focus on potential games , where such dynamics are especially natural , and define a new measure we call the price of uncertainty ( pou ) , that models the effect these perturbations can cause .", "to define the pou we assume at each step t an agent does a best ( or improved ) response to the cost function at time t .", "the pou of a given game bounds the ratio of the initial social welfare to the social welfare of any state that can be reached in such a dynamic .", "1 a small pou implies that the system can not deteriorate due to such perturbations in costs , and provides a certain degree of robustness to the system ; a large pou means that deterioration could be severe .", "note that all the games we consider have only a small gap between potential and cost , so without any fluctuations , these dynamics would never cause social welfare to deteriorate substantially .", "in addition , all the games we consider have near - optimal equilibria ( their price of stability is low ) , and they continue to do so even after perturbation : thus , the effect we are studying is not that the system moves to a poor state because good equilibria no longer exist , but rather whether small perturbations can lead natural dynamics astray .", "our results : we analyze a number of well - studied potential games from this perspective , including cost - sharing [ 2 ] , matroid games [ 1 ] , job - scheduling [ 13,8 ] , and the class of \u03b2 - nice games [ 3 ] , proving both upper and lower bounds on how resilient they are to such perturbations under both best - response and improved - response dynamics .", "our analysis shows a number of surprising distinctions between these games , as well as between these two dynamics .", "in some cases , we show even exponentially small perturbations can result in drastic increases in cost ; in others , polynomially - small perturbations are sufficient to ensure good behavior , and finally some are resilient even to constant - sized fluctuations .", "for example , in fair cost - sharing games with many players of each type , we show that with best - response dynamics , the price of uncertainty is constant even for constant \u01eb > 0 .", "however , with improved - response dynamics , even exponentially small fluctuations can cause an exponentially large increase in the cost of the system .", "on the other hand , with few players of each type , the game becomes less resilient , and constant - size fluctuations can cause even best - response dynamics to incur a pou of \u03c9 ( n ) , where n is the number of players , moving from an equilibrium of cost o ( opt ) to one of cost \u03c9 ( n \u00b7 opt ) , matching the price of anarchy of the game .", "for set - covering games , a natural special case of fair cost - sharing studied by [ 6 ] where players must choose which set to belong to and split the cost with others making the same choice , we show both best - response and improved - response dynamics have a logarithmic price of uncertainty for \u01eb = o ( 1 / ( mn ) ) .", "however , for matroid games ( a broad class that generalizes set - covering and many other games ) , while best - response dynamics continues to exhibit good behavior , improved - response dynamics again has exponentially large pou even for exponentially small \u01eb ( exponential in the rank of the matroid ) .", "we also give a technically intricate lower bound of \u03c9 ( \u01eb \u221a n / log ( 1 / \u01eb ) ) on the pou of best - response dynamics for set - covering games , showing that \u01eb < polylog ( n ) / \u221a n is necessary for polylogarithmic pou .", "finally , for the class of \u03b2 - nice games , which for constant \u03b2 includes congestion games with linear ( or constant - degree polynomial ) latency functions , market - sharing games , and many others [ 3 ] , we show that for random order bestresponse dynamics , the price of uncertainty is\u02dcois\u02dc is\u02dco ( \u03b2 ) .", "however , again for improved - response dynamics the pou can be exponential .", "we also present results for job scheduling on unrelated machines and consensus games .", "we also explore a different kind of robustness , which is a robustness to adversarial ( byzantine ) players .", "this can be viewed as a fault - tolerance of the system to a few misbehaved agents .", "for our lower bounds , we concentrate on the case of a single adversarial ( byzantine ) player , and measure to what degree can such a player can cause the system 's social welfare to deteriorate .", "we show agent 's behavior is the same .", "also , in general we assume that the initial state is arbitrary .", "it could be an equilibrium , in which case the pou can be viewed as studying the stability of the equilibrium .", "alternatively , the initial state might result from a change in the system ( adding or removing a link in routing , or adding or removing a machine in job scheduling ) .", "in such a case the agents dynamics start from a more arbitrary state .", "that for set cover games , a single byzantine player can cause bestresponse dynamics to move from an equilibrium of cost o ( opt ) to one of cost \u03c9 ( n \u00b7 opt ) .", "( this is as bad a situation as possible since the price of anarchy in such games is o ( n ) . )", "for job scheduling on two unrelated machines we show that a single byzantine player can induce a dynamic where the cost increases from 1 to \u03c9 ( n ) , and that the same is true for consensus
