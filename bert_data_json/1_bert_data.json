utility functions is a sum of arbitrary functions , each of which maps one of the above variables to a dollar value .", "furthermore , we assume that agents are riskneutral , and so agents ' utility for money is linear .", "we can thus write the equation for agent a i 's utility function as : u i = f ad i ( ad ) + f nv i ( nv ) + f al i ( al ) \u2212 f ds i ( ds ) + f bw i ( bw ) \u2212 f t.each

function for the variable f t because this variable represents an amount of money that is transferred to or from the agent .", "without restricting ourselves to particular f functions , we can make several observations that justify the signs of the terms above .", "first , f ad , f nv and f al must be monotonically increasing , with minimum value 0 , as these variables only ever contribute positive utility .", "likewise , ds and bw only contribute negative utility , explaining the subtraction of f ds and f bw above .", "finally , we make two assumptions about agents ' relative

from downloading files at level k is more than k\u03b2 , for some constant \u03b2 .", "second , in inequality ( 2 ) we assume that the monetary cost to agents of sharing files at level k and uploading

game theoretic analysis in the first part of this paper we often make the assumption that all agents have the same type .", "in section 6 we approach the file sharing problem experimentally ; this approach allows us to discuss the convergence of agent strategies under a wide variety of different agent types .", "as is central to any game theoretic model , we assume that agents are economically

given that all other agents ' strategies are fixed .", "finally , an agent has a dominant strategy if his best action does not depend on the action of any other agent .", "in our analysis , we restrict ourselves to file sharing systems that make use of centralized servers .", "these servers maintain a database of the files currently available on the network and connect download requests

penalized.one likely payment model for peer - to - peer systems is a flat rate membership fee .", "we do not explicitly consider this option anywhere in the discussion that follows , as it has no impact on the equilibria that arise from any mechanism ( although it can affect agents ' decisions about participation ) .", "all the mechanisms discussed here are compatible with the addition of flat rate pricing ; note especially that the fact that flat fees are unrelated to agents ' behavior implies that such pricing does not help avoid a free - rider problem .", "we analyze the napster system

strictly higher revenue than any other strategy .", "because \u03c3 is an equilibrium in dominant strategies , it is unique.we have identified a unique equilibrium in which nothing is shared and there is nothing to download .", "yet songs were plentiful and actively traded on napster .", "we identify two reasons that users might have contributed .", "first , napster offered its service free of charge and went to great lengths to foster a sense of community among its users , notably through such features as chat - rooms , a newsletter , and messaging between users .", "this may have been sufficient to encourage users to altruistically contribute resources that cost them very little .", "second , napster offered a ( modest ) disincentive for non-contribution : by default , the napster client shared all songs that an agent downloaded .", "this could be circumvented , but only by manually moving songs to another directory after download or explicitly shutting down the napster service .", "again , because the donation of resources cost users very little , many users may not have bothered to \" opt out \" .", "we represent both of these incentives through the variable ( al ) .", "in the analysis of this situation , we consider two types of agents .", "first , altruistic agents are those whose reward for altruistic behavior ( al ) exceeds its cost in terms of disk space ( ds ) and expected bandwidth usage ( bw ) .", "we assume that f functions for these agents are such that they would prefer the action \u03c3 2 to either the action \u03c3 1 or \u03c3 0 regardless of the value of bw .", "these agents still gain utility from downloads : following an argument similar to the one given above , ( \u03c3 2 , \u03b4 2 ) is a dominant strategy for altruistic agents .", "the second type of agents are those for whom the cost of altruistic behavior exceeds its benefit .", "1 these agents are essentially the same as those described in the previous section : although they may receive some payment for altruistic behavior , it will be insufficient to alter their behavior .", "they thus have the dominant strategy given above : ( \u03c3 0 , \u03b4 2 ) .", "this analysis is arguably a description of the way users behaved on the napster system .", "some proportion of agents were sufficiently altruistic to share files and did so ; other agents were not altruistic and shared nothing .", "regardless of their level of altruism , agents were unrestrained in their downloads .", "this conclusion coheres with the empirical research cited in the introduction claiming that only a small proportion of gnutella users share any files .", "likewise , it supports our claim that napster experienced a free - rider problem : regardless of the contributions of others , selfish agents had no incentive to share .", "as with all such problems , the situation in this case appears somewhat paradoxical , because all agents would be better off if they all shared ( due to the resulting increase in nv , the variety of files available on the network ) than they are under the unique equilibrium.we now turn to an examination of several alternative mechanisms that overcome the free - rider problem through the imposition of financial transfers .", "in order to avoid relying on altruism we assume that agents have no altruistic motivation , and so drop the term f al ( al ) from agents ' utility functions from here until section 6 , in which we present our experimental results .", "( of course , all of our results also hold for agents motivated by altruism . )", "we wish to encourage users to balance what they take from the system with what they contribute .", "a natural approach is to charge users for every download and to reward then for every upload .", "in this section , we propose and analyze a micro-payment mechanism designed according to this principle , as well as a variant of the basic mechanism.we begin with a detailed description of our micro-payment mechanism .", "for each user the server tracks the number \u03b4 of files downloaded , and the number \u03c5 of files uploaded during the time period .", "the server is aware of all such transfers since it processes all download requests .", "note also that there exist standard cryptographic protocols ( fair exchange , [ 3 ] ) to ensure that both parties agree on whether their exchange was aborted or ended successfully .", "at the end of each period , each user is charged an amount c = g ( \u03b4 \u2212 \u03c5 ) .", "we assume that g is linear with a coefficient \u03b2 representing the cost / reward per file ( e.g. , $ 0.05 ) , and that the value of this coefficient is such that inequalities ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) hold .", "note that the global sum of all micro-payments is 0 ; individual users , however , may make a profit by uploading more than they download.before considering the equilibria that arise under this mechanism , we must simplify it so that it can be represented in our model .", "2 let \u03c3 \u2212 i be the total number of units shared by agents other than a i , and \u03b4 \u2212 i be the total number of units downloaded by agents other than a i .", "if agent a i chooses the action 3 ( \u03c3 s , \u03b4 d ) then we express the expected value of f t ( a i 's expected payment to the system ) ase [ f t ] = \u03b2 d \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 i s n \u2212 2 n \u2212 1

himself .", "note that \u03b2 is the coefficient representing the cost per net unit downloaded.proposition 1 .", "\u03c3 = { ( \u03c3 2 , \u03b4 2 ) , . . . , ( \u03c3 2 , \u03b4 2 ) } is a unique ,

reduced , as compared to the case discussed in section 3 , but it remains positive .", "thus \u03b4 2 dominates \u03b4 1 and \u03b4 0 .", "if all agents other than a i follow the strategy s = ( \u03c3 2 , \u03b4 2 ) , and a i follows the strategy s i = ( \u03c3 s , \u03b4 2 ) , a i can calculate his expected utility for the different values of s : he will have e [ f t ] = \u03b2 2 \u2212 2 ( n \u2212 1 ) s 2n \u2212 4 + s .", "given our assumption about the cost of uploading a file , a i will strictly prefer the strategy s i = ( \u03c3 2 , \u03b4 2 ) ; thus \u03c3 is a strict equilibrium .", "now we show uniqueness of the equilibrium .", "note that it is dominant for all agents to choose \u03b4 2 , as described above .", "thus \u03b4 \u2212 i is 2n \u2212 2 in all equilibria 2 although the following analysis makes explicit use of the fact that there are only three levels of sharing and of downloading possible , this restriction has been made only for ease of exposition ; a similar ( albeit more complicated ) proof exists for any number of levels of sharing and downloading .", "3 to simplify the exposition we assume that \u03c3s denotes sharing s units , and likewise for all i. inequality ( 2 ) states that f ds ( k ) + f bw ( k ) < k\u03b2 : sharing is worthwhile for an agent if every unit of sharing yields at least one unit of uploading on expectation .", "substituting s = 2 into the expression for expected uploading from equation ( 3 ) , we find that it is thus worthwhile for an agent to choose the action \u03c3 2 when 2 ( n \u2212 1 ) 2 n \u2212 2 n \u2212 1 \u03c3 \u2212 i +2 \u2265 2 .", "rearranging , we find that \u03c3 2 is the most profitable strategy as long as \u03c3 \u2212 i \u2264 2 ( n \u2212 1 ) .", "this condition always holds since there are n \u2212 1 agents other than i and each agent can only share up to 2 units ; hence \u03c3 is unique .", "note that the same analysis does not suffice for the case of risk - averse agents .", "the problem is that agents directly control their number of downloads , but only indirectly control their number of uploads through the number of files shared .", "depending on the nature and degree of agents ' risk aversion and their particular utility functions , they may prefer to reduce their downloads to reduce their worst - case payments to the network .", "since the behavior of risk - averse agents depends so heavily on the particular assumptions we make about them we do not give a formal analysis here ; however , we return to this issue in section 6 .", "empirical evidence suggests that users strongly dislike micro-payments : having to decide before each download if a file is worth a few cents imposes mental decision costs [ 9 ] .", "users often prefer flat pricing plans , even when such mechanisms may increase their expected costs .", "to address this problem we introduce a quantized micro-payment mechanism where users pay for downloads in blocks of b files , where b is a fixed parameter .", "at the end of a time period , the number of files downloaded by a user is rounded up to the next multiple of b , and the user is charged for the number of blocks used .", "the pricing mechanism for serving files is unchanged .", "note that when b = 1 we return to the original micro-payment mechanism , while we approach a purely flat - rate pricing plan as b grows .", "in practice , we consider values of b on the order of the number of files that an average user would download per time period.we do not present an analysis of this class of mechanisms , for two reasons .", "first , in the abstract these quantized mechanisms are the same as general micropayment schemes , except that it is irrational for agents to download a number of files that is not an even multiple of b ( unless of course an agent has reached the maximum number of files that he desires ) .", "the key advantage of this class of mechanisms is that agents are spared the mental decision costs associated with per - download pricing ; since we do not explicitly include this cost in agents ' utility functions , the elimination of this cost does not affect the analysis .", "second , this class of mechanisms does not fit easily into our simplistic model for user actions : as we allow only three levels of downloading , it is unclear what to quantize .", "from the analysis in section 4 it is easy to see that if we charge agents the same for \u03b4 1 as for \u03b4 2 the original equilibrium is preserved : agents will simply be provided with additional incentive for taking the actions that they would take anyway.there are , however , some interesting practical issues arising from this class of micro-payment mechanisms .", "first we expose a way in which agents could gain through collusion , and present two possible remedies .", "we also consider problems arising from the trading of rare files and suggest one solution.first we examine an important way in which this mechanism could be attacked .", "quantized micro-payment mechanisms have the property that after one file has been downloaded , the marginal cost of downloading the remaining b \u2212 1 files belonging to the same block is zero .", "towards the end of a payment period , users may take advantage of zero - marginal - cost downloads left in their account to download files from friends , in order to cause these friends to receive the payment for serving these files .", "a coalition of users could agree to download excess files from each other and share the profit .", "the cost to the server is proportional to the difference between the number of files in a block and the average number of files actually desired by agents .", "however , this collusion can only reduce profits back to the case of simple micro-payments discussed above , where every download corresponds to an upload credited to another agent.we can modify the quantized payment mechanism so that it is harder for users to direct their zero - marginal - cost downloads to other specific users .", "this makes it harder for a coalition to generate money for itself : if a user has no control over who is making a profit out of his downloads , this attack becomes less profitable .", "we could modify our mechanism in one of two ways .", "first , the server can reply to each download request with a list of users serving files that match the request , but hide the identities of all the users .", "a user can choose to download from any of the locations listed , but can not specifically single out his friends .", "second , the server can reply to each download request with a random subset of all the users serving files that match the request .", "in this case user identities do not need to be hidden.observe that these solutions only make it less efficient to direct zero - marginalcost downloads to friends , but by no means make it impossible .", "furthermore , these solutions are less and less effective as the number of users sharing a given file decreases , because a user who stores files that are sufficiently rare will receive a large fraction of all the download requests for these files .", "thus we propose that rare files ( file for which the number of copies available falls below a threshold ) be treated differently from files that are more frequent .", "we can not simply refuse to credit users who serve rare files , because this would create a strong disincentive for introducing new files into the system .", "instead , the central server can give users no credit for serving rare files , but keep track of all the exchanges of rare files .", "if a file exceeds the threshold of frequency and becomes sufficiently popular , the users who shared it while it was still rare can be credited retroactively .", "previously , we focused on influencing users ' consumption by penalizing downloads and rewarding uploads .", "we take a different approach here : we continue to penalize downloads , but we now consider rewarding agents in proportion to the amount of material they share rather than the number of uploads they provide.the mechanism we consider makes use of an internal currency , \" points . \"", "4 agents are allowed to buy points either with money or with contributions to the network , but they are not allowed to convert points back into money .", "since agents can not \" cash out \" their points , they might be allowed to maintain a balance from one time period to the next .", "we do not consider such a rolling balance since we model a single time period ; furthermore , in a repeated equilibrium agents would have no incentive for accumulating more points than they spend .", "5 agents ' payment for sharing is m ( t ) dt , where m ( t ) is a measure of the amount of data made available for download at time t and the integral is taken over the whole time period .", "downloading a file costs cm points , where m is a measure of the file 's size and c is a constant .", "intuitively , c represents the number of hours one file must be shared in order for the cost of one download to be waived.as above , we must simplify this mechanism in order to analyze it according to our game theoretic model .", "one point costs \u03b2 , where \u03b2 is set to a value such that inequalities ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) hold .", "furthermore , assume that all files have the same size and that agents always share files for the same amount of time ( one time period ) .", "each level of sharing in one time period earns one point ( e.g. , \u03c3 2 is worth two points ) .", "we take c = 1 , so each level of downloading costs one point .", "downloaded files are not shared in the same time period as they were downloaded .", "as above , we assume that downloaders are matched uniformly at random with shared units , and that no agent may download from himself .", "thus , if a i shares at level s then his expected number of uploads , \u03c5 i , is : e [ \u03c5 i ] = \u03b4 \u2212 i s n

arising from this mechanism .", "first we consider agents ' opportunities for collusion and for other undesirable exploitation of the system , and discuss remedies.unlike quantized micro-payments ,

the overall value of the network .", "a possible remedy is to offer distributors different rewards based on expected download demand .", "the formula to reward distributors thus becomes m ( t ) \u03bb
